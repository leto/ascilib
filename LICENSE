AScilib consists of packages and acts like a distribution of libraries. All
libraries are free software existing under an open source license, such as the
GPL2, GPL3, BSD or artistic license. Each individual library has its own
license - please check the root folder of the clib, usually in
./src/clib/libraryname/ and the information that is in the original source tree
of the project. We try to take care of compatibility between licenses in
ASciLib. If you find a conflict between licenses, or missing information,
please report this to the ASciLib project.

If a license is not specified the code contributed to ASciLib defaults to the
BSD license:
