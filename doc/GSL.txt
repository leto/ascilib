* GSL

The GSL is in the process of getting mapped based on the Math::GSL
bindings for Perl.

There are quite a few mappings around for the GSL libraries. Both
Python and Perl have SWIG mapped editions. The Ruby version is 'hand'
mapped. With ASciLib we hope to end up with one mapping for all
languages.
