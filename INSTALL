* QUICK INSTRUCTIONS:

Fetch the repositories:

  git clone git://github.com/pjotrp/ascilib.git
  cd ascilib
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

The configure script is a convenience wrapper. For a Perl build of biolib:

  ./configure
	make
	make test
	make install

For a Ruby build:

  ./configure --with-ruby
	make
	make test
	make install

For a Perl build:

  ./configure --with-perl
	make
	make test
	make install

** Using CMake directly

The following makes the default libraries:

  cmake .
  make
  make test

** Using Rake (with Ruby)

To install BioLib with Ruby support one can simply execute rake:

  rake build
	rake test
	rake install

For installations specific to Perl, Python etc. see below.

* INSTALL biolib

Install or build the following tools on your system

  gcc    >  3.3.x  (usually default on Linux)
  cmake  >= 2.6    (2008 distributions - needed for SWIG support)
  swig   >= 1.3.33 (2008 distributions)
  python >= 2.4    (if you want Python support)
  ruby   >= 1.8.6  (if you want Ruby support)
  perl   >= 5.8.8  (if you want Perl support)

So for Debian you can do:

  apt-get install g++ cmake swig r-base zlib1g-dev python ruby perl

see also ./doc/DEPENDENCIES.txt for more information on runtime libraries.
cmake 2.6 is available in Debian testing and etch-backports. 

** TROUBLE SHOOTING

When switching between build parameters make sure to remove the CMakeCache.txt
file in all directories.  This can be achieved with sh ./scripts/cleanup.sh.
